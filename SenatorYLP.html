<!-- PROJECT DETAILS SECTION -->
<section class="project-details">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Over five years ago, somewhere between 7th and 8th grade, I emailed my Fairfax County School Board member to complain about school lunches and pushed hard for reforms I felt students deserved. I did not know much about policy back then. I just knew something felt wrong and that speaking up mattered.

Last week, I was accepted into and attended Senator Stella Pekarsky’s 2025 Youth Leadership Program. That school board member I emailed years ago? It was Stella Pekarsky, back when she held that position.

Being in Richmond felt full circle. What started as a frustrated middle school email turned into meaningful conversations inside the General Assembly with the very people shaping education and healthcare policy today. Throughout the program, I engaged with senators, delegates, legislative staff, lobbyists, and advocates on issues ranging from education funding to updated diabetes accommodation protocols in schools. I observed committee and subcommittee hearings, toured the Capitol and the General Assembly Building, and gained a deeper understanding of how policy moves from idea to law.

I was honored to be publicly recognized by Senator Pekarsky in the Virginia Senate Chamber and by Delegate Karrie Delaney in the House of Delegates. I also actively participated in in-depth policy discussions across multiple panels, engaging with education, immigration, and housing advocates, including representatives from La Casa, on issue-based advocacy, and later questioning Chief of Staff Alex Kellum from Senator Pekarsky’s office about career pathways, institutional access, and how young people can meaningfully contribute to policymaking.

What stood out most was not just learning how the system works, but realizing how much consistent advocacy compounds over time. Senator Pekarsky has been a constant example of what it looks like to listen seriously to students and translate community concerns into real policy work. In many ways, her leadership created the space for students like me to keep asking questions, pushing for better outcomes, and staying engaged.

This experience reaffirmed why I care so deeply about education. Advocacy does not start when you get a title. Sometimes it starts with a nervous email sent by a middle schooler who just refuses to stay quiet.

On a final note, I am once again eternally grateful to Senator Pekarsky, Owen Kathcart, Alex Kellum, and everyone who made this program possible.
